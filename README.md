# Cygnus Core Harvesters

This repo contains all harvesters used in Cygnus.

Since all capital deposited in core contracts are earning rewards, the core contracts allow external contracts called "Harvesters" to compound rewards into more LPs (for collaterals) or more stablecoins (for borrowables).

The harvesters are integrated with 1inch and are permissionless, callable by anyone to reinvest rewards and earn a percentage from the rewards.
